# Physical Design Projects Summary (7nm, 14nm, 45nm)

This repository provides a concise overview of three physical design projects executed at different technology nodes, focusing on the implementation flow from floorplanning to signoff.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### üß© Project 1: DMA MAC Block (7nm)
- **Standard Cell Count**: 1.6M | **Macros**: 40 | **Frequency**: 1 GHz
- Handled floorplanning with high macro count and congestion challenges.
- Performed placement, CTS, routing and signoff achieving timing closure and IR drop fixes.
- Tools: ICC2, PrimeTime, RedHawk

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project 2: Peripheral Controller Block (45nm)
- **Standard Cell Count**: 23.6K | **Macros**: 12 | **Frequency**: 125 MHz
- Full physical design flow including congestion-aware floorplan and port-bound timing fixes.
- Applied iterative optimization to fix post-placement routing congestion.

### üîå Project 3: Interface Block (14nm)
- **Standard Cell Count**: 380K | **Macros**: 86 | **Frequency**: 1 GHz
- Complex CTS with skew balancing and timing ECOs.
- Worked with floorplan team to optimize IO port placements.
- Fixed IR drop via power grid enhancement .
